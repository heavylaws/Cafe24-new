"""Services package for the Cafe24 POS application.

This package contains business logic services.
"""
# This file makes the 'services' directory a Python package.

# This directory is intended for business logic that is too complex
# for routes or needs to be reused across multiple routes.

# For v0.1, much of the logic might reside directly in the route handlers
# for simplicity, but as the application grows, services become crucial
# for maintainability and separation of concerns.

# Example (conceptual, not implemented for v0.1 yet):
# from .order_processing_service import process_new_order, calculate_order_totals
# from .menu_service import get_formatted_menu
# from .user_service import create_user_account
