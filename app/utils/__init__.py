"""Utilities package for the Cafe24 POS application.

This package contains utility functions and decorators.

# This file makes the 'utils' directory a Python package.

# You can optionally import utility functions here to make them directly accessible
# from app.utils import some_function
# e.g. from .helpers import round_lbp, calculate_lbp_price

# For now, it can remain empty.
