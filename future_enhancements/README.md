## Implementation Guidelines

Each phase directory contains:
- **Requirements**: Technical requirements and dependencies
- **Configuration**: Setup files and environment configuration
- **Migrations**: Database migration scripts
- **API**: API route definitions and schemas
- **Documentation**: Implementation guides and specifications
- **Tests**: Test plans and validation scripts

## Development Approach

1. **Preparation Phase**: Set up infrastructure and dependencies
2. **Foundation Phase**: Implement core functionality
3. **Integration Phase**: Connect with existing system
4. **Testing Phase**: Comprehensive testing and validation
5. **Deployment Phase**: Gradual rollout and monitoring

## Getting Started

Each phase can be developed independently while maintaining compatibility with the existing system. Start with the preparation files in each phase directory.
